# My Personal Projectï¼š Consumption management application

## Introduction

**What will the application do?**

In this software, I hope to make it very convenient for 
users to manage their daily consumption. The software records 
the time, type and amount of each purchase. This software can also 
count the total amount of consumption over a period of time, and 
can visually see the proportion of each type of consumption through 
the graphical interface.

**Who will use it?**
This software is aimed at people who have just left home and started 
to live on their own. These groups are dominated by college students 
and young people just entering the workforce. The first thing these 
people need to do when they enter the society is to manage their own 
property. In the past, most of the expenses were managed by their 
families, but now they need to rely on themselves.

**Why is this project of interest to you?**
As an overseas student living far away from my hometown, 
I found that I had never had any experience in managing my 
own assets, and this ability was indispensable. So 
I'm going to complete this visualization and help 
other people who are facing the same challenges as me.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to add New consumption to my Consumption mananger.
- As a user, I want to be able to select a consumption and add date, Consumption type, spending in consumption.
- As a user, I want to be able to view the list of tasks on Consumption list.
- As a user, I want to be able to count the total amount spent in Consumption list
- one that expresses the user's ability to save the entire state of the application 
(e.g. the to-do list, recipe list or state of all pieces in a board game) to file
- another that expresses the user's ability to reload that state from file and resume exactly 
where they left off at some earlier time

## Phase 4: Task 2
- "get total balance."

  The presence of this field indicates that the user requested that the total cost be calculated once

- "addcons: date: 02/10 type: apple amount: 10$"

  The presence of this field indicates that the user has added a new consumption record

## Phase 4: Task 3
- If I had more time, I would separate the consumption type as a new class so that I could better manage the consumption 
type. And I would optimize ShutdownHook to integrate this functionality into the Gui instead of executing it in main.
